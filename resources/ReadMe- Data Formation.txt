1. Scrape all the tweets for both hashtags
2. Merge the two data sheet for two hashtags
3. Remove repeated tweets (containing both hashtags)

We have achieved the file of data scraped - "scrapedTweetsData"

4. Convert the string list of hashtags to #hashtag using convertTo#.py

We have achieved the file of all hastags converted to this format #hashtag - "convertedStringTo#"

5. Merge the all #hashtags format to the original file of data scraped ("scrapedTweetsData" + "convertedStringTo#")

We have achieved the file of data scraped we can work with - "Final_Parking_Data"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can merge these two our final data with professor's data, however it is not a good idea since the timeline is different and display of data will not be precise with time.

We continue to work with file provided - 20K_parking_data

1. Get separate data files from 20K_parking_data with #parking and #parkinglot hashtag by running program "getHashtagData.py"

2. We get parking-Dataset and parkinglot-Dataset to work with.
